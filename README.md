# ChallengePasswordGenerator

Project referring to the week 3 challenge of the University and Toronto's  Cooding bootcam.
The project consists of a password generator that takes into account parameters such as: number of letters in the password, whether the user wants the password to contain uppercase letters, lowercase, special characters and/or numbers.
The user just needs to click on the "Generate Password" button and answer the questions for the password to appear at the end.
